# Principles

## Structure mods

Structure mods should be more than adding/improving structures to look good. They need a reason to be there (think about Terraria structures)

Points to judge such mods:

- Navigability: the structure should be navigable on survival and free of micro obstacles
- Challenges: be it mobs, traps or puzzles. These should be beatable and fair on survival
- Consistency: the structure should not be composed of dozens of non sense blocks just because it looks pretty
- Dynamics: the structure should be a place where something happens and not a lifeless static set of blocks
